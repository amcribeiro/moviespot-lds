# MovieSpot (LDS Project)

Full-stack cinema management and booking platform developed as an academic project for **Software Development Labs (LDS)**.

The project follows a multi-layer architecture and focuses strongly on **automated testing**, **CI pipelines** and **reproducible environments**.  
While the backend is fully implemented, the frontend focuses on two critical features developed during the course.
